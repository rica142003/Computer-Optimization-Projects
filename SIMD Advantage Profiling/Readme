# Introduction


# Setup
- Fix CPU frequency, the command  lscpu | grep "MHz" was used to check the freq and it the CPU in MHz is 2496.011MHz
this will be continuously checked to ensure it doesn't change
- pin to a core taskset -c 2 ./your_program
- each program is pinned to core 1 first thread core using taskset -c 2 ./saxpy_scalar
to find how many threads are on the core, lscpu | grep Thread shows 2 threads, but lscpu -e shows my 8 cores and each of its threads
